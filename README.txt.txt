Object Oriented Programming Language Detector - Nathan Garrihy
A language detector developed in Java which compares a query text file against a kMer collection of subject texts and determines the natural language of the query file.

Getting Started
Once you run the Runner class of the program you will be prompted to enter the wili text file name (including the .txt) you will then be prompted to enter the querytext file name (including the .txt). Once this is done after a few short seconds, the 2 files are parsed and compared and the result (Language of the query file) is output to the screen. You are then presented with a menu where you have the following options

enter:
1 to Change the Wili File name
2 to Change the Query File name
3 to Change the Kmer number
4 Re-runs the comparison of query text file against kmer collection and outputs result.
-1 end the program
